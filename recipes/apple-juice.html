        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Instead of spending big bucks for fresh, healthy apple juice, learn how easy it is to make your own.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>18 Apples</li>
                <li>Cinammon (optional)</li>
                <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by washing and then coring the apple to remove seeds. Cut the apples into slices. There is no need to peel the apples.</li>
                <li>Add the apples to the pot and add enough water to just cover them. Too much water and you will have pretty diluted juice. This juice may come out a bit strong, but it is a lot easier to dilute the juice with extra water rather than trying to make the flavor stronger.</li>
                <li>Slowly boil the apples for about 20-25 minutes or until the apples are quite soft. Place a coffee filter or piece of cheesecloth in your fine mesh strainer and place over a bowl.</li>
                <li>Taste the juice after it is cooled for a bit. You can add additional sugar or cinnamon depending on your preferences. Again, if the flavor is too strong, you can add water a little bit at a time to weaken the flavor.</li>
                <li>The apple mush you collected can easily be turned into applesauce by pureeing and adding a smidgen of sugar and cinnamon to taste.</li>
                <li>Keep in mind your homemade apple juice does not have any preservatives so be sure to keep it refrigerated and to use it within a week!</li>
            </ol>
